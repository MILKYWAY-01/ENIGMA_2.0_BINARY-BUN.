Here's a comprehensive prompt you can use to build this web app:

---

## 🧬 Prompt: Early Stage Cancer Detection Web App

```
Build a production-grade AI-powered Early Cancer Detection System web application using React. 

---

### CONTEXT & PURPOSE
This is a clinical-grade medical tool used by oncologists, radiologists, and screening centers to detect cancer at early stages using AI analysis of medical imaging, blood biomarkers, and patient history.

---

### DESIGN DIRECTION
- Aesthetic: Medical precision meets calm confidence — dark navy/deep teal base with crisp white text, sharp electric-cyan accents for alerts and risk scores, subtle grid textures
- Tone: Clinical, authoritative, trustworthy — NOT corporate SaaS. Think: mission control for human health
- Typography: Monospace for data/scores (JetBrains Mono), clean serif for headings (Playfair Display), modern sans for body
- Animations: Smooth data loading pulses, risk gauge fills, scan upload progress indicators

---

### PAGES & FEATURES

#### 1. 🏠 Dashboard (Main View)
- Live stats: total patients screened, high-risk flags, pending reviews, model accuracy %
- Risk distribution chart (donut) — Low / Moderate / High / Critical
- Recent screening activity feed
- Top 5 high-risk patients with quick-action buttons

#### 2. 👤 Patient Screening Workflow (Multi-Step Form)
Step 1 — Demographics: Age, sex, ethnicity, family history, smoking/lifestyle factors  
Step 2 — Biomarker Input: Upload blood panel CSV or manual entry (PSA, CEA, CA-125, AFP, etc.)  
Step 3 — Medical Imaging: Drag-and-drop upload (MRI/CT/X-ray) with thumbnail preview  
Step 4 — AI Analysis: Animated "analyzing" state → risk score output with confidence %  
Step 5 — Report: Printable PDF summary with recommendations  

#### 3. 📊 Risk Prediction Dashboard
- Patient list with sortable risk scores (0–100)
- Color-coded risk bands: Green (0-25), Yellow (26-50), Orange (51-75), Red (76-100)
- Individual patient drill-down: risk breakdown by category (genetic, lifestyle, biomarker, imaging)
- Trend chart: risk score over time per patient
- Export to CSV/PDF

#### 4. 📈 Model Accuracy Report
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, AUC-ROC displayed as animated metric cards
- Confusion matrix heatmap visualization
- ROC Curve chart (using Recharts)
- Comparison table: AI model vs traditional screening methods
- Version history of model updates

#### 5. 🏥 Clinical Validation Framework
- Protocol documentation viewer
- Validation study results table (institution, sample size, accuracy, date)
- IRB approval status tracker
- Bias audit section: performance across demographic groups
- Regulatory compliance checklist (FDA, CE Mark, HIPAA)

---

### TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- React with hooks (useState, useEffect, useReducer)
- Recharts for all data visualizations
- Tailwind CSS utility classes only (no custom CSS files)
- Lucide React for icons
- All data should be realistic mock/simulated data (no real API calls needed)
- Fully responsive (mobile + desktop)
- Single-page app with tab/sidebar navigation
- Accessible (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)

---

### MOCK DATA TO INCLUDE
- 15–20 mock patients with varied risk profiles
- Realistic biomarker values
- Model metrics: ~91% accuracy, 0.94 AUC-ROC
- 3 validation studies from different institutions

---

### KEY UI COMPONENTS
- `<RiskGauge />` — animated radial gauge showing 0–100 risk score
- `<PatientCard />` — compact card with name, risk badge, last screened date
- `<BiomarkerTable />` — color-coded table flagging abnormal values
- `<ScreeningWizard />` — multi-step form with progress bar
- `<ModelMetricCard />` — animated number counter for accuracy stats

---

### WHAT MAKES IT UNFORGETTABLE
A full-screen "ANALYZING PATIENT" overlay with a DNA helix animation and real-time scanning effect when the AI processes a new patient — building tension before revealing the risk score with a dramatic gauge fill animation.
