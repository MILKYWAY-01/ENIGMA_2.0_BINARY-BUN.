## Notes
Tailwind Config - CSS variables map directly to the existing config, so no changes needed there. 
Fonts (Inter, Playfair Display, JetBrains Mono) are imported in index.css and mapped to the standard Tailwind classes (font-sans, font-serif, font-mono).
The UI is forced into a dark-themed "Medical Precision" aesthetic using CSS variables on the root.
